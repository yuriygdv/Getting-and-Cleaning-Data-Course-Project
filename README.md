## Getting and Cleaning Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset 

In this project, I use the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset provided in several files to create a tidy, ready-for-analysis data set. I will process the following data files from the original data set:

**features.txt**  - variable names (561 names)

**activity_labels.txt** -- activity labels (6 activities)
